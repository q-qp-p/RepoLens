# Behavioral contract for the severity single-source-of-truth helpers and the
# filename/frontmatter mismatch detector (issue #331).
#
# Decision encoded by the issue: frontmatter `severity:` is the SINGLE SOURCE
# OF TRUTH. The title `[SEVERITY]` prefix and the filename slug are display-only
# and must NEVER override the frontmatter value. When the title prefix disagrees
# with frontmatter, the run must surface a non-fatal warning without dropping or
# mutating the finding — frontmatter always wins.
#
# This file is written BEFORE the implementation (TDD red phase). The two pure
# helpers (severity_from_title, detect_severity_mismatch) and the warn wired
# into count_dry_run_issues do not exist yet, so the helper tables and the
# "mismatch is logged" integration assertion fail until the implementer adds
# them. The two preservation guards (agreeing case emits no warning; the
# filename slug is never used as a severity source) pass before AND after the
# change — they pin behavior the issue requires to be kept, not introduced.
#
# Mirrors tests/test_severity_normalize.sh / tests/test_finding_type_normalize.sh
# for the pure-helper tables and tests/test_min_severity_observability.sh for
# the count_dry_run_issues integration setup. No real model is ever invoked.
